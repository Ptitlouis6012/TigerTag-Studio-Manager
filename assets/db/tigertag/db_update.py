# it is a paged POST rather than a single GET, and `all/last_update` carries no
# `products` key, so there is no server timestamp to compare before downloading.
#
# Named `id_catalog.json` like its `id_*.json` neighbours: it is the same kind of
# reference data — it holds every TigerTag+ product id.
# It is bundled with the app so a fresh install has a catalogue on FIRST LAUNCH,
# offline, instead of an empty Search view until the first sync lands. Keeping it
# in git also makes the catalogue's own evolution reviewable — a new field shows
# up as a diff instead of silently reaching the renderer — and gives an entry
# count to tell users about, for new brands and filaments.
